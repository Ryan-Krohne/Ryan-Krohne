**`Future Software Engineer`**

I'm a college student heading into the field of software engineering. While I am not a computer science major, the Information Technology degree has key fundamental required to be a software engineer, such as mathematical skills, knowledge of networking, an Object Oriented language, and Data Structure and Algorithms.s.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ryan's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive Information Technology student with a passion to learn everything I could about technology. I built a computer in higschool, and I loved using and interacting with technology. At the time, I did not know what degree to pursue, so I chose an Information Technology degree because it was broad and could help me understand where my passion would be. My degree showed my I had no desire to do any sort of physical work, and slowly, my passion for programming started to emerge. Currenlty, I know several software engineer that have worked at Disney, Amazon, or similary companies and hearing the work they do inspires me to be a better software engineer. I currently have a strong understanding of Python, and MySQL through my college courses, and I am teaching myself the rest in order to be a good software engineer.

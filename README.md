Hi! I'm a college student heading into the field of software engineering. While I am not a computer science major, the Information Technology degree I am pursuing has taught me key fundamental relevant to the software engineering world. These include Object Oriented Programming, SQL, and various programming languages.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ryan's Coding Journey (Click here to expand!)</h3></summary>
  Hi! Thanks for making it this far!<br><br>
   I first touched coding in my early teens when I was introduced to scratch, but I eventually lost interested. In my early teens, I changed the world (or so I thought) by deleting the search bar from google. Messing around with developer tools at a young age was a lot of fun, however I never made a connection to how coding impacted the real world.
  
  <br><br>When I first got in to college, I naively decided to pursue a degree in Information Technology, as I was completely unaware of what I wanted to do with my life. Fortunately, college was when I was re-introduced to software development. Currently, I find myself highly motivated by considering the difference I make in the real world - something that's hard to see if you only think of software development as working on stories and completing pull requests.
